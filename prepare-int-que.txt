1) What is Angular, and what are its key features?
Ans: 
 Angular is TypeScript-based front-end framework developed by Google. Key features include:
 - Component-based architecture
 - Two-way data binding
 - Dependency Injection
 - Routing 
 - RxJS for reactive programming
 - Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation

2) Explain the component lifecycle in Angular?
Ans:
 Angular components go through the following lifecycle hooks:
 - ngOnInit() - called once after component initialization.
 - ngOnChanges() - called when input-bound properties change.
 - ngDoCheck() - custom change detection.
 - ngAfterViewInit() - when the component's view is initialized.
 - ngOnDestroy() - cleanup before destroying this component.

3) What is dependency injection in Angular?
Ans:
 Dependency Injection is design pattern in which components get their dependencies from a central injector rather than creating them. Angular uses Dependency Injection to improve modularity and testing.

4) How do you handle forms in Angular?
Ans:
 Angular provides:
 - Template-driven forms (simple, uses directives)
 - Reactive forms (more control, uses FormBuilder, FormGroup, FormControl)
   I mostly use reactive forms for complex validaions and better unit testing.

5) What is RxJS, and how do you use it Angular?
Ans:
 RxJS is a reactive programming library used with Angular form handling asynchronous events using Observables. I use RxJS for:
 - HTTP requests (HttpClient)
 - Debouncing user inputs
 - Combining multiple observables using operators like mergeMap, switchMap, forkJoin

6) What is lazy loading in Angular?
Ans:
 Lazy loading allows us to load feature modules only when they are needed. It improves performance by reducing the initial bundle size.

7) How do you optimize performance in Angular apps?
Ans:
 Some ways I use:
 - Lazy loading
 - ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
 - TrackBy function in *ngFor
 - Avoiding memory leaks with unsubscribe
 - Using pure pipes and caching results

8) How do you handle error handling in Angular
