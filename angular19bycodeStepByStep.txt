angular que of angular 19 by code step by step
*Angular Intro?
 - We need to install Node for angular
 - MVC architecture
 - Angular js and angular are different
 - angular release on 14-Sept-2016
 - Current version is 19

*Why Angular?
 - Fast loading.
 - Fast development
 - Angular provide alot of features : 
   validation library,  routing, component bases structure
 - large community

*What is angular CLI?
 - Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps developers create, build, test, and deploy angular applications.
 - Commands that help you to develop angular application.



*Angular 20 Introduction:
 - Angular 20 has been released on 29 May 2025
 - Developed by: Google.
 - Front end/ Client Side Framework.
 - In this version, special emphasis has been placed on performance, developer experience and modernization.

*What is angular?
 - The Angular is the newest form of the AngularJS, developed by Google, which is an open source front-end development platform used for building mobile and desktop
   web applications. Angular is rewritten by the same team built that built AngularJS.
 - It is a Javascript framework for building web applcations and apps in Javascript, HTML, and Typescript, which is a superset of Javascript. The angular now comes
   with every latest feature you need to build a complex and sophisticated web or mobile application. It contains feature like component, Directives, Forms, Pipes, 
   HTTP services, Dependency Injection and many more.
 - Angular is one of the most popular frameworks for building client apps with HTML, CSS, and Typescript.  

*Angular Versions:
 - Angular versions: 1) major 2) minor 3) patch
   For example, version 20.1.2 indicates major version 20, minor version 1 and patch version 2. The version number is incremented based on the level of change included 
   in
 - Major releases contain significant new features, some but minnimal developer assistance is expected during  the update. When updating to a new major release, you may need
   to run update script, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs.
 - Minor releases contain new smallest features. Minor releases are fully backward compatible; no developer assistence is expected during update, but you can optionally
   modify your apps and libraries to begin using new APIs, features and capabilities that were added in the release. We update peer dependencies in minor versions by
   expanding the supported versions, but we do not require projects to update these dependencies.
 - Patch releases are low risk, bug fix releases, No developer assistance is expected during update.

*Release frequency:
 - A major release every 6 months
 - 1-3 minor release for each major release
 - A patch release almost every week

*Support Policy:
 - All of our major releases are supported for 18 months.
 - 6 months of active support, during which regularly-scheduled updates and patches are released, as described.
 - 12 months of long-term support(LTS). During the LTS period, only critical fixes and security patches will be released. 

*Nodejs:
 - Node.js is a server side platform built on Google chrome's javascript engine. Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
 - Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js application are written in javascript,
   and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.
 - Node.js also provides a rich library of various Javascript modules with simplifies the development of web applictions using Node.js to a great extent.
 - Node.js is an open source server environment
 - Node.js is free
 - Node.js runs on various platforms(Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.
 - Node.js = Runtime Environment + Javascript Library

*Where to Use Node.js?
Following are the areas where Node.js is proving  itself as a perfect technology partner.
 - I/O bound Applications
 - Data streaming Applications
 - Data Inensive Real-Time Application(DIRT)
 - JSON APIs based Applications
 - Single page applications

 
   

*Angular 20 new features and updates details:
1) Zoneless change detection:
 - Earlier in angular, every time there was a change in the DOM, zone.js used to track where to update. Now in Angular 20, a "zoneless" method has been introduced, 
   which means now you cando change detection even without zone.js
 Benenfits:
 - No more need for zone.js.
 - Faster performance and lighter apps.
 - Easier debugging and better micro frontend compatability.
 - Currently in developer preview.

2) Sectorless Components:
 Earlier, to use a component, it had to be imported first into the module and then into the components, all this hassle is over:
 Benefits:
 - No need to import components in multiple places.
 - cleaner and more module code.
 - simplifies component creation and usage.

3) Signal Based Forms:
 Earlier there were two types of forms in Angular - Template-driven and Reactive forms, Now signal-based forms have been introduced in Angular 20, which is a new, easy
 and scalable way.
 Benefits:
 - Unified and modern approach to handling forms.
 - Type-safe and scalable stucture.
 - Better integration with Angular's reactivity model.
 - Backward-compatible with existing forms.

4) Modern Testing Tools:
 Angular 20 has deprecated the old Karma test runner and you can now use these new and faster test runners:
 Benefits:
 - Goodbye to Karma test runner.
 - Welcome modern tools like: 
   Jest, Vitest, Web Test Runner
 - Faster, simpler, and more reliable testing.

5) Enhanced SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
 SSR means your Angular is first rendered on the server, then on the browser. SSR has been further improved in Angular 20:
 Bnenfits:
 - Faster and more flexible SSR.
 - Route-specific rendering strategies.
 - Better SEO and performance.

6) Other Improvements
 - Typed Forms support continues.
 - ESBuild Integration -> Faster builds.
 - NgOptimizedImage Directive for better image handling.
 - New Control flow syntax (simplified *ngIf, *ngFor, etc.)



7) What is booting process in angular 20?
 - In Angular 20, the booting (bootstrapping) process means how an Angular application starts and loads the first component in the browser.

🧠 One-Line Definition (Interview Ready)
Bootstrapping in Angular 20 is the process where Angular initializes the framework and loads the root standalone component using bootstrapApplication() 
to render the application.

If you want, I can also explain:
 - Bootstrapping with vs without routing
 - Difference between Angular 15 vs Angular 20
 - Bootstrapping lazy-loaded apps
 - Bootstrapping flow with diagram for interviews

8) Main Building blocks of an angular appliction

9)Common decorators:
 - @NgModules() to define modules.
 - @Component() to define components
 - @Injectable() to define services
 - @Input() and Output() to define properties. that send and receive data from the dom.
 There are many built-in decorators available in Angular and many properties on each decorator	

10)Types of Decorators
 - Class decorators, e.g. @Component and @NgModule
 - Property decorators for properties inside classes, e.g. @Input and @Output
 - Method decorators for methods inside classes, e.g. @HostListner
 - Parameter decorators for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. @Input
 Each decorator has a unique role

11)@Hostlistener decorator
 - It is called method decorator
 - When you use @hostlistener decorator It is calling below funtion only other below or above function of @hostlistener
 - and it is use for method calling decorator

12)Selector
 For example, here are some ways you can specify the selector attribute and how to use it in HTML
 - element-name: Select by element name.
 - .class: Select by class name.
 - [attribute]: Select by attribute name.

13)Feature of standalone component

14)Style, StyleURL & StyleUrls:
 We can represent our styles, ie the CSS code within the @Component decorator in two ways.
 Inline Styles:
 - the inline style are specified directly in the component decorator. In this, you will find the CSS within the TypeScript file. This can be implemented using the
  "styles" property.
 External Styles:
 - The External style define CSS in a separate file and refer to this file is styleUrl.means In this, we will find a separate CSS file instead of finding a CSS within
  the TypeScript file. Here, the typescript file contains the path to that style sheet file with the help of the "styleUrls" property.

15)preserveWhitespaces:
 - preserveWhitespaces is used to tell Angular whether to keep or remove extra spaces and line breaks from component templates. 
   It is helpful when exact formatting is required, such as in preformatted text or inline layouts.
 - true → keeps spaces & new lines (useful when exact formatting matters)
 - false → removes extra spaces (default, better performance)

16)Encapsulation:
 - To emulate the shadow DOM and encapsulate styles, angular provides three types of view encapsulation are the folowing.
   Emulated(default): The main HTML styles are propagated to the component. The styles defined in the component's @Component decorator are limited to this component only.
 - Native/shadow DOM: The main HTML styles are not propagated to the component. The styles defined in the component's @Component decorator are limited to this component only.
 - None: The component styles are propagated to the main HTML and therefore are visible to all components of the page. with apps that have none and native components
   in the application. All components with encapsulation none will have their duplicate styles on all components with native encapsulation.

 *Emulated:
 - No Shadow DOM
 - Style encapsulation

 *Native:
 - Shadow DOM
 - Style encapsulation

 *None:
 - No Shadow DOM
 - No style encapsulation

17)Directives:
 - Basically, directives are used to extend the power of the HTML attributes and to change the appearance or behavior of a DOM element.
 - Directive in Angular is a javascript class, which is declared as @directive. Angular has 3 types of directives, which are listed below:
   component directives, structural directives and attributes directives.
 *Component directive:
 - If any component load in another component and change of DOM structure it is called component directive.
 - A component directive in Angular 20 is a directive with a template that controls a part of the UI.
 - It uses @Component, Has HTML + CSS + logic, Always has a selector and a template
 *Structural directive:
 - A structural directive in Angular 20 changes the DOM structure by adding or removing elements.
 - type of two directive namely @If, @For and @Switch in angular 20
 *Attribute directive:
 - An attribute directive in Angular 20 changes the appearance or behavior of an existing element.
 - Does not add or remove elements
 - Works by changing styles, classes, or attributes
 👉 In short:
 Attribute directive modifies how an element looks or behaves.

*@switch: 
 - Switch is an angular directive that displays one element from a possible set of elements based on some condition.
 - and It is a case sensitive. 
 - In old (angular 19) syntax If we create duplicate case so getting multiple data which has create as duplicate.
 - but in new in angular 20 getting 1 record in duplicate data. It has resolved in angular 20.

*@for:
 - The @for block repeatedly renders content of a block for each item in a collection.
 - Syntax:
   @for(item of items; track item.name){
    <li>{{item.name}}</li>
   }@empty{
    <li>There are no items.</li>
   }
 - Inside @for contents, several implicit variables are always available:
 Variable Meaning:
 $count - Number of items in a collection iterated over
 $index - Index of the current row
 $first - Whether the current row is the first row
 $last - Whether the current row is the last row
 $even - Whether the current row index is even
 $odd - Whether the current row index is odd

*ngStyle Directive:
 - The NgStyle  directive allow you to set a given DOM elements style properties.
 - One way to set styles is by using the NgStyle directive and assigning it an object, like so <div [ngStyle]="{'background-color':'green'}">Hello World</div>
 - This sets the background color of the div to green. 

*ngClass Directive:
 - It controls the appearance of elements by adding and removing CSS classes dynamically.
 - ngClass work with string, array and object

*data binding

*Attribute Binding:
 -It is a one way data binding and Its process of component to view.
 - Attribute Binding alway gives a old value. 
 - We can use rowspan and colspan in table

*Property Binding:
 - Property Binding alway gives a currant value. (check diff between attribute binding and property binding.

*CSS Class binding:
 - Class binding in angular makes it very easy to set the class property of a view element. We can set or remove the CSS class names from an elements class attribute
   with the help of class binding.

*innerHTML:
 - using innerHTML we can bind any html. we can write html code/ tags using innerHTML.
 - Its will create in any tag and creates inner tag which we use like div or span 

*Interpolation vs property binding:
 - Interpolation get fails when we work with boolean value.

*Short Summary
| Binding Type             | Direction        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Property / Interpolation | Component ➜ View |
| Event                    | View ➜ Component |
| Two-way (`ngModel`)      | Component ↔ View |

👉 In one line:

 - Component to View → Property binding
 - View to Component → Event binding
 - Both → Two-way binding

*Event binding:
 There are 2 type of syntax we can write in angular 20:

| Syntax                | Called As                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `on-click="click2()"` | **Inline HTML event handler / DOM event attribute** |
| `(click)="click2()"`  | **Angular Event Binding**                           |

*pipe:
 - Angular pipes can be used to transform data to desired output.
 - Pipe has 2 pipes which is Built-in pipes and custom pipes
 - In Built-in pipes are pipes namely parameterized and chaining

*Server-Side Rendering(SSR) :
 - SSR (Server-Side Rendering) means rendering Angular applications on the server instead of only in the browser.
 - The server generates the full HTML of the page and sends it the the client.
 - The browser then displays content immediately and Angular takes over for interactivity.

*Why do we need SSR?
 - Faster First Load - The user will see a page quickly because the HTML is pre-rendered.
 - SEO Friendly - Search engines(Google, Bing, etc.) can crawl real content.
 - Better Social Media Previews - proper meta tags and content are visible.
 - Improved User Experience - No "blank screen" while Angular is loading.

*Advantages of SSR in Angular 20
 - Faster initial page load
 - Better SEO
 - Works well on slow networks or low-end devices
 - Essential for blogs, e-commerce and content heavy apps

*Hydration in Angular?
 Hydration in Angular means:
 - After the server has already rendered the HTML(via SSR), Angular on the browser reuses that HTML into a live Angular app.
 - It does not re-render the DOM, It just "hydrates" the static HTML into a live angular app.	

*To create SSR angular app 
 - ng new projectName
 - asking du you want to create zoneless app - say n
 - select css
 - Do you you want to enable server side rendering - say y

*to build anular application write command:
 - ng build
 - in CSR folder created as dist folder and inside folder namely broswer like projectfoldername/browser
 - in SSR folder created as dist folder and inside folder namely browser and server
 - to activate server go package.jcon and find it like serve:ssr:ssrangularapp
 - to run write command on terminal like npm run serve:ssr:ssrangularapp

*Service:
 - Service is a mechanism used to share the functionality between the components.
 - koi service kisi dusre service ko inject karna ho to use injectable hona jaruri hai 

*Tree shaking service:
 - It is unused service process called Tree shaking service

*Routing in angular

*Routing:
 - To parse the URL, Angular uses the following conventions:
 - / - slashes divides URL segments
 - () - parentheses specify secondary routes
 - : - a colon specifies a named router outlet
 - ; - a semicolon specifies a matrix parameter
 - ? - a question mark separates the query string parameters
 - # - a hashtag specifies the fragment
 - // - a double slash separates multiple secondary routes

authentication - to use if user login karke aaya hai ya nahi?
authorization- mean after login user ko konse konse page pr rights hai.(after authentication apko kis kis page par rights hai)

*routing configuration syntax:
export const routes: Routes = [
    {path:'home', component: Dashboard, title:'Home Page'},
];

*wildcard route:
 - wildcard route to intercept invalid URLs and handle them gracefully.
 - if page not found then we use wildcard route
 - to use wildcard like: {path:'**', component: Pagenotfound, title:'Page not found!'}

*baseURL:
 - not neccessory to  use base url on top routes of object. we can use any line in object.
 - to set baseURL
 export const routes: Routes = [
    {path:'', redirectTo:'home' pathMatch:'full'}
    {path:'home', component: Dashboard, title:'Home Page'},
    {path:'aboutus', component: Aboutus, title:'About Page'},
    {path:'**', component: Pagenotfound, title:'Page not found!'}
 ]
 - {path:'', component: Dashboard}, //other way but home not shong in url

*Route Guards:
 - There are 5 types of guards we use in Angular.
 1) CanActivate - This helps to decide whether the route can be activated or not 1 (route ko activate krne ke liye authentication check krte hai(check login or not).)
 2) CanActivateChild - This helps to decide whether child routes can be activated or not.
 3) CanDeactivate - This helps to decide whether the route can be deactivated or not. Generally, this is used to warm a user if they are navigating from the component. (kisi page ko leave kar karte time puchta hai are u sure to leave this page)
 4) Resolve - This performs route data retrieval before any activation of the route. (resolve mean kisi page pr jane se phle hm check krte hai data available hai ya nahi)
 5) CanLoad - Checks to see if the user can navigate to the module which is lazily loaded.

 - In short:
 1) CanActivate guard (e.g. it checks route access).
 2) CanActivateChild guard (checks child route access).
 3) CanDeactivate guard (prompt for unsaved changes).
 4) Resolve guard (pre-fetching route data).
 5) CanLoad guard (check before loading feature module).

 - to create guard command: ng g guard guard-name
*Auth guard- authentication ke liye auth guard use karte hai taki without login user koi page access nahi kar paye.

*Route Link Active:
 - The RouterLinkActive is a directive for adding or removing classes from an HTML element that is bound to a RouterLink.
 - Using this directive, we can toggle CSS classes for active Router links based on the current RouterState.

*Diff between local staorage and session storage?

*Session Manangement:
 - 2 types of data storage which is session storage and local stogage.

*Local storage:
 - there is no expiry date for data storage.

*What is Session storage?
 - The session storage object is equal to the local storage object, except that it stores the data for only one session. The data is deleted when the user closes the
   specific browser tab.

*Cookies
 - A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's machine by the user's web browsers while the user is browsing.
 - Cookies are small packages of information that are typically stored in your browsers and websites tend to use cookies for multiple things.
 How to install a cookie
 npm install ngx-cookie-service --save
 cookie methods are:
 1) Check - This method is used to check the cookie existing or not.
 2) Get - This method returns the value of given cookie name.
 3) GetAll - This method returns a value object with all the cookies
 4) Set - This method is used to set the cookies with a name.
 5) Delete - This method used to delete the cookie with the given name
 6) deleteAll - This method is used to delete all the cookies.

*Forms
 - Forms are the main building blocks of any application. When we use forms for login, registration, submission, help request, etc.
 two types of forms in angular:
 1) Template-driven forms
 2) Model-driven forms(Reactive forms)

*Reactive Forms:
 Prerequisite: We need to import ReactiveFormsModule in our app.module.ts file.
 Reactive Form Features
 - More flexible, but needs a lot of practice
 - Handles any complex scenarios
 - More component code and less HTML markup
 - Easier unit testing.
