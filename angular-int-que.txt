1) Do you know what kind of guards were used for this?
 - CanActivate: This guard decides if a  route can be activated. 
   It's commonly used for implementing authentication and authorization checks before allowing access to a route.

 - CanActivateChild: similar to CanActivate but specifically child routes.

 - CanDeactivate: This guard decides if a route can be deactivated. 
   Its often used for implementing confirmation dialogs or checks before leaving a route with unsaved changes.

 - CanLoad: This guard prevents lazy-loaded modules from loading if certain conditions are not met. Is useful for optimizing intial application load times.

 - Resolve: While not technically a guard, its often used in conjunction with guards. 
   Resolve is a feature that prefetches data before a route is activated, ensuring that the route has all the necessary data before rendering.

 - Authguard: This is custom guard that developers often create to implement application-specific authentication and authorization logic.

2)*Authentication: 
 - Proving who you are, often through a username and password or other credentials.

3)*Authorization:
 - Determining what you are allowed to do or access besed on your identity, roles, and permissions after you've been authenticated.

4)What is SSR (server side rendering)?
 - SSR in Angular means Server-Side Rendering, where the HTML is generated on the server and sent to the browser. 
   It helps improve page load speed and SEO. Angular Universal is used for this.

 how its works?
  - When a user requests a page, the server compiles the Angular app and renders the page into HTML.
  - The browser receives HTML content immediately, which improves performance and SEO.
  - Once the page is loaded, Angular takes over (hydration) and makes the page interactive.


5)localization for angular app?
 - It's useful for making apps user-friendly for people in different regions.

6)Why we use intercepter?
 - We use an interceptor in Angular to intercept and modify HTTP requests or responses globally. 
   It's mainly used for adding headers like auth tokens, handling errors, logging, or showing loaders during API calls.
 - Examples:
   Add JWT token to every request
   Show a loading spinner during API calls
   Handle 401 unauthorized errors in one place

7) What is argument in function?
 - when we call the function and adding value inside thats called argument.

8)What is parameter?
 - When we define or declare any function and passing any value thats called parameter.
